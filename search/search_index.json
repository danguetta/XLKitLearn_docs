Simply surround the variable with <code>C()</code>. For example, suppose you are fitting a model on the Boston housing dataset provided with XLKitLearn, and that you want to predict the median property value using the crime per capita and the highway accessibility treated as a categorical. The formula would be</p> <p><code>median_property_value ~ crime_per_capita + C(highway_accessibility)</code></p> <p>A few notes. (a) When a variable is treated as categorical, dummies will always be created for every possible value of that variable. The first dummy (in alphabetical order) will then be dropped from the model. (b) Any column containing non-numerical values will automatically be created as a categorical, with or without the <code>C()</code> around it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Standardizing variables: Surrounding any variable with <code>standardize()</code> will subtract the mean of that variable form every value in the column, and divide by its standard deviation. This can be particularly useful when comparing the size of coefficients in a linear regression. Note that when using training and test sets, this transformation will be done correctly; the mean of the training set will be used to standardize variables in the evaluation set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Including all variables: To include every variable in the data as independent variables in your model, simply use <code>~.</code>. For example, suppose you are fitting a model on the Boston housing dataset provided with XLKitLearn, and that you want to predict the median property value using every other variable in the data. The formula would then be</p> <p><code>median_property_value ~ .</code></p> </li> </ul> <p>Categorical Variables and <code>~.</code><p>As mentioned above under \"Creating categorical variables\", any column containing non-numerical values that is explicitly named in the formula will automatically be treated as a categorical variable. This, however, is not true of variables that are implicitly included using <code>~.</code>. Therefore, if any of your columns contain non-numerical values, using a <code>~.</code> will result in an error.</p> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Including interaction terms: It is sometimes necessary to include an interaction term (wikipedia reference) in a predictive model. This is done using the <code>*</code> character. For example, suppose you are fitting a model on the Boston housing dataset provided with XLKitLearn, and that you want to predict the median property value using the interaction of crime per capita and highway accessibility. The formula would be </p> <p><code>median_property_value ~ crime_per_capita * highway_accessibility</code> </p> <p>Note the the <code>a*b</code> construction is shorthand for <code>a + b + a x b</code>. In the example above, the model output would include both crime per capita and highway accessibility as dependent variables on their own, as well as the interaction term.</p> </li> <li> <p>Removing the intercept: An intercept will be added to the formula by default. Adding <code>-1</code> at the end of the formula will remove the intercept.</p> </li> <li> <p>Applying Python functions: Any Python function can be used as part of a formula; <code>numpy</code> functions can be accessed using <code>np.</code>. For example, suppose you are fitting a model on the Boston housing dataset provided with XLKitLearn, and that you want to predict the median property value using the crime per capita and the crime per capita squared. The formula would be</p> <p><code>median_property_value ~ crime_per_capita + np.power(crime_per_capita, 2)</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Creating yes/no outcomes: XLKitLearn will automatically interpret any formula in which the outcome column contains only 0s and 1s as a classification task.</p> <p>XLKitLearn also supports one-versus-all classification models, in which an outcome column is converted to a 1 if it is equal to a certain value, and 0 otherwise. This is best illustrated by example. Suppose you are fitting a model on the Boston housing dataset provided with XLKitLearn, and that you want to predict whether the highway accessibility is equal to 4 or not using every other column in the data. You would use the following formula:   <code>(highway_accessibility = 4) ~ .</code>   The model will then interpret all rows in which highway accessibility is 4 as a '1' outcome, and '0' otherwise. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Non-numeric Columns as dependent variables<p>Including a non-numeric column as the dependent variable will return an error unless a yes/no outcome is created in this way.</p> </p> <p>Note that XLKitLearn's formulas leverage the Patsy Python library, which itself approximates R-style formulas. Any formula features available in Patsy can also be used in XLKitLearn. Some of the features described above, however, are not directly available in Patsy.</p>"},{"location":"predictive_analytics/#specifying-a-predictive-model","title":"Specifying a Predictive Model","text":"<p>The final component of any predictive analytic workflow is the model that will be trained and used to make predictions.
