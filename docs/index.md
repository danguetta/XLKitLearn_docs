This Excel add-in makes it easy to analyses like linear/logistic regressions, boosted decision trees, random forests and text analytics. These analyses use tools like K-fold cross validation, lasso penalties, TF-IDF weights and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. A working understanding of all of these approaches and tools is assumed, but links are included for reference.
